/*
Const value can't be changed.
For declaring variable always use let and not var because the var keyword was used in previous
times for declaring the variable but at that time javascript was unaware about the problem of
scoping. Later the problem was fixed by introducing a new keyword 'let'. 
Also we can define the variable with no keyword but it is not appropriate way of defining the 
variable. And only defined variable has undefined value.
